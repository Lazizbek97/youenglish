Searching YouTube Videos by phrase or word that is used in it.
## Getting Started
 - To run the project you should have YouTube API keys and credentials for the project. 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [I have used YouTube Data APIv3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
- [I have built a service using Flask to search videos by ID, search its captions and time the prase is used. You can run the service file insdie project 'youbute_captions.py' by running on terminal python3 youbute_captions.py]()
